# from-scratch

Building neural networks from scratch with Python.

## Projects

**micrograd** -- Autograd engine and neural network library. Scalar-valued automatic differentiation with backpropagation, plus a small neural network API built on top.

**makemore** -- Character-level language model. Generates new words by learning patterns from a dataset of names, using bigram models and MLPs.

**cnn** -- Convolutional neural network framework. NumPy-based CNN with manual forward/backward passes for all layers (Conv2d, pooling, BatchNorm, etc.), targeting CIFAR-10 image classification. Optional PyTorch backend for GPU speed.
